Welcome to my blog! I’m a Web Application Security Specialist on a journey toward earning the OSCP certification and advancing into penetration testing. Here, I document my experiences, share insights, and provide walkthroughs to help others in the cybersecurity community. My posts cover a range of topics, from HackTheBox modules to tips for tackling real-world challenges. Currently, I'm following HackTheBox Academy’s Bug Bounty Hunter Job Path, sharing my process and learnings from the bug bounty rooms.

I also focus on four main areas of penetration testing: Web Application Pentesting, Network Pentesting, Active Directory Penetesting, and Cloud Pentesting. I hope this space becomes a valuable resource for others on similar paths. Let’s learn and grow in this field together!
